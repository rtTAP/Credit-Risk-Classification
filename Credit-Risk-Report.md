## Overview of the Analysis

* Purpose of the analysis:
    * The purpose of this analysis is to predict the likelihood of a loan being high-risk (defaulting) using a logistic regression model. The dataset contains information on various loans, and the model aims to classify these loans as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1).

* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithm).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarise the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
Perhaps using alternative models such as Random Forest, or Isolation Forest, which is designed to detect outliers potentially creating an improved detection of high-risk loans.  Another attempt to improve high-risk loan predicting could be to add another feature or features to the loan data set.  There are several data tuning methods and models which could be used.  A best practice approach to any data set may be to 'get to know' and understand the data set well, and clearly define what the purpose of the analysis is.
